summary: This is the first project i've ever made in java. At the time we didnt learn about OOP so everything was hardcoded in.

Ball game is a simple game that has characters and balls that you need to dodge. We used the EZ.java library. To play the game you use WASD keys to control the player and you must dodge a bunch of balls that always target the player when it hits a wall. Some of the problems I encountered with the project was we didnt have the concept of functions so every calculation was rewritten.
