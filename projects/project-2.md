summary: The second project that includes what I learned after making the simple ball game.
---
This project was made a little differently because it includes how much I learned during ICS111. Instead of everything being hardcoded we learned OOP, so making the changes significantly changed the way I write my code. I really enjoyed it because instead of writing hundreds of lines of code, we learned to use objects and functions to make it a little easier on ourselves.

Learning about objects made the second project a lot more fun because instead of creating a object with a picture, we learned that we could make an array of objects. When I was taking the class I liked to mess around with EZ java and create a bunch of things all at once to make my computer lag. I found it fun trying to find the perfect amount of things to add to the screen without crashing everything. Using the functions we created we could apply that to the objects we created and I was overjoyed because copy pasting got boring.
