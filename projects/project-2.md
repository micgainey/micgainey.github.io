summary: The second project that includes what I learned after making the simple ball game.
---
This project was made a little differently because it includes how much I learned during ICS111. Instead of everything being hardcoded we learned OOP, so making the changes significantly changed the way I write my code. I really enjoyed it because instead of writing hundreds of lines of code, we learned to use objects and functions to make it a little easier on ourselves.
