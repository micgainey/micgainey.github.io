summary: StudyUHp was created with the intention to encourage the use of ICSpace and to encourage face to face meetings among ICS students.

[StudyUHp](https://github.com/study-uhp) was made using react, semantic-ui, meteor, mongodb, and other styling frameworks. We wanted to make a webapp to encourage ICS students to have face to face meetings in ICSpace. When creating the app, we used many of the things that we learned in class and found other npm packages to add to our system. The system had 3 main parts. The profile page for each student registered, the session page that showed all the sessions that were being held in ICSpace, and finally the calendar that showed which days and what times the sessions would be held at. There was also an admin implementation that would give access to a list of users and gave the admin permission to edit sessions.

In our application you could add sessions from the main session tab, and the calendar tab, making it very user-friendly. Some of my major contributions to the system were designing a game aspect that could be implemented later. This functionality would give an incentive to the students to use the webapp. Unfortunately, we were not able to implement it because we had a lot of system changes at the end. Another thing that I worked on was dealing with the database system to add users to a session. That issue was particularly hard because the user database was not showing any of our users. After some patience and a lot of research I finally figured out how the simple schema really worked.

A few things that I learned from this experience was that working in a team can be really challenging but is very rewarding. It taught me a lot of about how to work as a team, and the amount of effort needed to complete a project. I also learned a lot about software engineering as a whole, and how to successfully use documentation to move forward when I encounter problems.
