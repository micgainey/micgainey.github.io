In our early years of education, we were often told that “There is no such thing as a stupid question”.
However, that is not always the case. Some are outright stupid, and others are asked in a not so smart way. 
When in school, we ask not so smart questions all the time because were looking for an exact answer and our best 
resource is our teacher. But, in the world of Software Engineering asking a question takes up voluntary time. 
Therefore, we must ask questions in a way that doesn’t come off as making someone feel like they are doing our work for us.

## How can we ask smart questions?

We can ask smart questions by following Eric Raymond’s “How To Ask Questions The Smart Way”. This includes things like trying to 
solve the problem yourself before you even ask the question, ensuring that you’re posing in the right forum, using meaningful 
AND specific subject headers, and being precise and informative about your problem.

## Subject: How to access the correct `this` inside a callback?

“I have a constructor function which registers an event handler: . . . However, I’m not able to access the data property of the
created object inside the callback. It looks like `this` does not refer to the object that was created but to an other one. I also 
tried to use an object method instead of an anonymous function: . . . but it exhibits the same problems. How can I access the 
correct object?”

This question gives us a good idea of what is wrong and how to solve the problem, According to Raymond’s article he satisfied the
criteria of a smart question by giving examples of what he did before hand, ensuring that he posted in the right forum, used
meaningful and specific headers, and he was very precise about his problem.

## Give me an example of a smart question.

Unlike that header, there are many people who ask questions like this. An example of this is “Please help on some regular expressions”.
In this question, the asker simply said in his description that he is reading from a book and gives 4 problems for the readers to solve. 
This doesn’t follow the criteria for a smart question because: -	In the description it doesn’t show any effort by the asker, and simply
tells the readers to solve the problems for him. -	He didn’t use meaningful and specific headers by leading with “Please help”
which isn’t meaningful and “… regular expressions” which isn’t very specific to the question that he was asking. Finally, he wasn’t 
precise about the question he asked. Instead he listed out the problems that he couldn’t solve himself.

## We should all start trying to ask ‘smart’ questions

In the first example we saw that a good question is very informative and it’s easy to see that the person asking
the question put effort in trying to figure it out themselves first. Therefore he was given smart responses that probably
helped the asker figure out the answer to the question himself. There were also people that gave links that explained the
question to him which is very helpful, and it gives him a chance to figure out what it all meant himself.

In the second example we saw that there wasn’t any effort at all and the asker simply wanted someone to give him the answers
and although he got a reply, there were other people asking the responder why he just gave out the answers, and was given
sarcastic responses.
