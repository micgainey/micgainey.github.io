## Overview:

*The problem:* College is very expensive. There are many different costs associated with college, one of them is books.
The bookstore has used books for purchase but sometimes even the used section is very expensive. As a UH Manoa student,
I have noticed that whenever it is time to buy books for class I end up just buying whatever they have at the bookstore
because when looking at the posting boards around campus, its very cluttered and I find it difficult finding anything
that I really need.

*The solution:* Instead with this application, we can do this differently. There will be a login that lets you add books
to your profile, and you can decide whether you want to sell, rent your book out, or even just loan it to a friend.
If everyone were to use it there would be a lot of used resale books on the market instead of the ones found at the bookstore.

## Mockup page ideas:

There will be a homepage that explains the application works and will give you an option to log in or sign up. There will 
be two different roles. Users who can login, post listings of the books that they own and have in their possession. 
The second user is admins, that have access to the book postings. They will be able to edit and remove listings. 
-Landing page
-User home page
-Admin home page
-Posting boards will have different catagories (Math, Science, English, History) and will have a major specific posting page (Business, ICS, EDU, Premed, etc.)

## Use case ideas:
-New user goes to landing page.
-There will be a sign-in page, for them to complete their profile.
-On the landing page there will also be a login on the nav bar for current users to use.
-After logging in they will then have the option to post a new listing, or browse the different catagories.
-Admin logs in and is able to edit listings.

## Beyond the basics:

Some alternatives or advanced features:
-Ensuring that the users signing up are UH students (checking for UH email).
-Filters on the browsing page, such as looking up specific books (ex: BIO101).
-Allowing updates or notifications to email on posted listings by the user.
-Payment through the application?
