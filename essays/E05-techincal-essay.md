Some of my interests in software engineering was something that I've always wanted to do. I first heard about it when looking up, "Jobs working with computers". I was always interested in computers ever since I was young and always looked forward to learning about how things work. I dont know much about software engineering, and hope to learn a lot more in this class.

Skills that I acquired that realates to computers so far are learning Java, Python, C, and C++. I've also completed ICS311 on algorithms, which has taught me many things about how programs run and their runtime analysis. Other than the classes that I've taken in school, I've learned how to write scripts for games that I frequent in python.

I hope to learn more about software engineering by taking this class, and I look forward to learning about web development. When browsing the internet I found myself accidentally hitting F12 which brings up the developer tools and the "inspect" feature, and looking at it always gave me anxiety because I've never understood what any of that means. Hopefully by the end of this class I can accidentally open it and instead of freaking out and hitting alt+F4, I can look at it and learn about how the specific webpage is running.
