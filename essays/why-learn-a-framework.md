## The beginning....

Learning HTML and CSS wasn’t that hard in the beginning. Although it’s completely different from most coding 
languages, I found that the tags and simple text links were quite easy. Then I was given the assignment 
browser history 3. The real introduction to CSS. Unlike the practice on FreeCodeCamp it was completely different 
because they told you exactly what to do with examples beforehand. There were many issues that I ran into.
The first was when extending the webpage, I found that my columns weren’t spaced correctly, and it took a bunch
of trial and error to get the page to look exactly like the picture. The second problem I ran into was when I was
experimenting with the browser history WODS, to try to make it a little nicer. Because the links that we put in the
webpage were very basic. I gave up trying to make it look good with HTML and CSS alone because almost
everything I found online linked me to a framework of some sort.

## Semantic UI

Semantic UI was a game changer for me. When we had the first practice WOD, there were so many different options.
All the classes we were given helped me tremendously because, instead of doing everything in CSS, I could simply
use a UI class that did the styling for me. Then if I wanted to edit the classes I could! I feel that UI frameworks
help speed up the development process because the styles given are easy to understand and it helps lower
the amount of code needed for a webpage.

## Should you learn Semantic UI?

Absolutely! I found that making a nicer webpage was quite simple after I got the hang of it. There was
a lot less code, and it gave me more time to work on design. There are many classes and design choices to
choose from, and it makes it a little simpler to understand. It is very tedious to learn in the beginning and
can get quite frustrating but once you get the hang of it, it’s very useful.
