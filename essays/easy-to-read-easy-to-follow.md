When I wrote my first program, I didn’t understand the concept of coding standards. When someone finally explained it to me, I thought that it was trivial because if the application worked the way I intended it to, then there’s no problem. My opinion then was, “if it worked, then its right.” For a while my opinion on the subject didn’t change. There was no reason for me to change because every block of code was written for my eyes only, and usually done in one sitting. I was very naive and believed that changing a few things with my writing style was pointless because it didn’t change the outcome or final product that I envisioned.

## What am I looking at?

After gaining a little bit of experience, I challenged myself by writing larger projects. These projects were a little more complex than the simple ones I’ve done before; however, as a beginner they required a lot more time to finish. This is when I realized that the way I wrote my code wasn’t necessarily wrong, but it was unreadable to every other person that I asked for help. As I said earlier, these projects took a lot more time, so I found myself working on it in multiple sittings. Nothing is worse than coming back to a project completely lost because, nothing was documented and the eyestrain from the lack of spaces.

## College coding?

The first time I was really introduced to coding standards was ICS211. Unlike the previous class we were required to install a Checkstyle that frustrated me to no end. EVERY SINGLE LINE HAD A YELLOW HIGHLIGHT. Which meant that I wasn’t complying with the simple and very easy coding standard for the class, instead I was writing code blocks with little to no indentation, terrible variable naming schemes, and a lack of comments.

## Coding standards FTW!

As I progressed in the class, I learned to write in a specific way and it really helped when asking for help and coming back to work on it after a break. I am now an avid believer in coding standards and support it wholeheartedly. Coding standards especially help when working in a group setting because if everyone is using the same standard, the overall project is easier to read and looks a lot nicer to someone reviewing your work. On top of that, training yourself to follow a standard will help you acclimate when getting a job.

## Where am I now?

I still consider myself a beginner to programming and computer science, but I don’t believe I have a problem with coding standards. From previous classes, I have trained myself to use spaces when needed, tabs when needed, and I rarely get yellow highlights anymore. It also helps when reviewing myself and tracing the functions in my head. Overall, coding standards are an important habit to form, and once mastered you can’t even tell the difference.
